  * Dynamic Taint Analysis for Automatic Detection, Analysis, and Signature Generation of Exploits on Commodity Software, _James Newsome_, NDSS 2005
    * *Summary*: the paper describes a dynamic instrumentation technique that is more efficient and precise than the state-of-the-art approaches in 2005.
    * *What can we take from it?* We should use some optimization techniques to mitigate the impact of our instrumentation.
